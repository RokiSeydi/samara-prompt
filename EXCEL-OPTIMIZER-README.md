# SAMARA Excel Optimizer - Real Transportation Roster Optimization

## Overview

The SAMARA Excel Optimizer is a production-ready web application that allows transportation companies to upload their existing Excel-based roster files and automatically optimize driver assignments, vehicle allocation, and route scheduling using AI-powered algorithms.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ **Real Excel File Processing**

- Upload .xlsx and .xls files directly in the browser
- Automatically detects and parses Drivers, Vehicles, and Routes sheets
- Flexible column mapping supports various Excel formats
- Sample file available for testing

### ðŸ§  **AI-Powered Optimization**

- Intelligent driver-to-route assignment based on license requirements
- Vehicle allocation optimization considering capacity and maintenance
- Conflict resolution for overlapping schedules
- Cost minimization and efficiency maximization

### ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Analytics**

- Real-time cost savings calculations
- Efficiency improvement metrics
- Conflict resolution tracking
- Before/after comparison views

### ðŸ’¾ **Export & Integration**

- Download optimized roster as Excel file
- Maintains original format with optimized assignments
- Ready for integration back into existing workflows

## How It Works

### 1. **File Upload & Parsing**

```typescript
// The system automatically detects these sheet patterns:
- Drivers: 'Drivers', 'drivers', 'Driver_List', 'Staff'
- Vehicles: 'Vehicles', 'vehicles', 'Fleet', 'Buses'
- Routes: 'Routes', 'routes', 'Services', 'Lines'
```

### 2. **Data Processing**

The optimizer extracts and normalizes data from Excel sheets:

**Driver Records:**

- ID, Name, License Type
- Shift Times, Current Vehicle/Route
- Status (available, sick, vacation)
- Cost & Hour Constraints

**Vehicle Records:**

- ID, Type, Capacity, Location
- Status, Fuel & Maintenance Costs

**Route Records:**

- ID, Name, Start/End Locations
- Distance, Duration, License Requirements
- Priority Level, Time Windows

### 3. **Optimization Algorithm**

```typescript
async optimizeRoster(drivers, vehicles, routes) {
  // 1. Clear existing assignments
  // 2. Sort routes by priority (high â†’ medium â†’ low)
  // 3. Assign drivers based on:
  //    - License requirements
  //    - Availability status
  //    - Hour constraints
  //    - Location proximity
  // 4. Allocate vehicles considering:
  //    - Capacity requirements
  //    - Maintenance status
  //    - Cost efficiency
  // 5. Resolve conflicts and optimize schedules
  // 6. Calculate metrics and generate recommendations
}
```

### 4. **Results & Export**

- **Cost Savings**: Reduced operational costs through optimal assignments
- **Efficiency Gains**: Improved resource utilization percentages
- **Conflict Resolution**: Eliminated scheduling conflicts
- **Downloadable Excel**: Optimized roster ready for implementation

## Testing with Sample Data

### Quick Start

1. Visit: `http://localhost:5173/?demo=excel-optimizer`
2. Click "Download Sample Excel File"
3. Upload the sample file (25 drivers, 20 vehicles, 15 routes)
4. Click "Optimize with SAMARA"
5. Download the optimized results

### Sample Data Structure

```
ðŸ“Š Sample Transportation Roster:
â”œâ”€â”€ Drivers Sheet (25 records)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Mixed license types (Standard, CDL Class A/B, Passenger)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Various shift patterns and locations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Realistic availability status
â”œâ”€â”€ Vehicles Sheet (20 records)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Different vehicle types (Bus, Minibus, Coach, Van)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Varying capacities (15-90 passengers)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Cost and maintenance data
â””â”€â”€ Routes Sheet (15 records)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Distance and time requirements
    â””â”€â”€ License and capacity constraints
```

## Excel File Format Requirements

### Required Columns (flexible naming):
